module: graphiant_gateway_services
short_description: Manage Graphiant Gateway Services (cloud gateway and connectivity)
description:
  - >-
    Manages Graphiant Gateway Services via C(POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/gateways). Two service
    types are supported under the top-level C(gatewayServices) key in the config file:
    C(cloudGateway) (cloud peering for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle) and C(connectivity)
    (site-to-site IPSec VPN gateway, C(ipsecGatewayPeers)).
  - >-
    The C(create) operation is idempotent create-or-update. Services that do not exist are
    created; existing connectivity services are updated in place when the config changes, and
    services that already match are skipped. To change a service, edit the config file and
    re-run C(create).
  - >-
    Update is not supported for cloud gateway services (C(create)/C(delete) only). Only
    connectivity services can be updated; a re-run of C(create) against an unchanged cloud
    gateway is skipped rather than updated.
  - >-
    Region names, LAN segment names, and speeds in the config file are resolved to the API
    C(regionId)/C(vrfId) and the S-prefixed speed enum (e.g. C(1Gbps) -> C(S1Gbps)) before
    the request is sent. Region, LAN segment, and any connectivity C(vpnProfile) names are
    validated against the enterprise before any gateway is pushed, failing fast with the list
    of available values when a name is not found.
notes:
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic value substitution."
  - >-
    With C(ansible-playbook --check), writes are skipped but C(changed) reflects whether an
    apply would create, update, or delete at least one service. Use C(--diff) to preview the
    pending changes.

  operation:
    description:
      - Operation to perform.
      - C(create) creates services that do not exist and updates existing connectivity services (idempotent).
      - C(delete) removes the services defined in the config file.
      - When omitted, it is derived from C(state) (C(present) -> C(create), C(absent) -> C(delete)).
    type: str
    required: false
    choices: [ create, delete ]
  state:
    description:
      - Desired state, used to derive C(operation) when C(operation) is not set.
    type: str
    required: false
    default: present
    choices: [ present, absent ]
  detailed_logs:
    description: Enable detailed logging in the task result message.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  force_update:
    description:
      - Re-push every matching C(connectivity) gateway (PUT) even when the idempotency comparison
        finds no change.
      - Tunnel C(psk), inside CIDRs, and BGP C(md5Password) are excluded from the comparison (they
        are auto-generated/auto-allocated per apply when left null), so a rotated secret is not
        otherwise detected. Set this to C(true) after changing a PSK/MD5 value to make it take effect.
      - Applies to C(create) only and to connectivity gateways only; cloud gateways are never
        updated (change one via delete + create).
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  vault_gateway_ipsec_psks:
    description:
      - Connectivity tunnel pre-shared keys, keyed by gateway name then peer name then tunnel.
      - >-
        Each tunnel C(psk) is sourced by one of three modes, in precedence order:
        (1) DIRECT INPUT — a non-null C(psk) in the config file is used as-is;
        (2) VAULT — a C(psk) left C(null) in the config is filled from this dict when a matching
        C(gateway/peer/tunnel) entry exists;
        (3) API AUTO-FILL — a C(psk) left C(null) with no matching vault entry is auto-generated
        by the portal. Add entries here only for tunnels you want vault to supply.
      - 'Structure: C({<gateway name>: {peer-1: {tunnel1: <psk>, tunnel2: <psk>}, peer-2: {...}}}).
        The peer key is C(peer-<N>), 1-based over C(remotePeers).'
    type: dict
    required: false
    default: {}
  vault_gateway_bgp_md5_passwords:
    description:
      - Connectivity BGP MD5 passwords, keyed by gateway name (C(ipsecGatewayPeers.name)).
      - Used to fill C(routing.bgp.md5Password) when left C(null) in the config (BGP routing only);
        a non-null value in the config takes precedence. Optional — if unset, BGP runs without MD5.
      - 'Structure: C({<gateway name>: <md5 password>}).'
    type: dict
    required: false
    default: {}
attributes:
  check_mode:
    description: Supports check mode.
    support: full
    details: >
      In check mode, no configuration is pushed; the module still reads current state to
      determine whether changes would be made.
  diff_mode:
    description: Supports Ansible's C(--diff) for pending gateway service changes.
    support: full
    details: >
      When the playbook runs with C(--diff) and a service would change, the module returns a
      C(diff) dictionary (C(before) / C(after)). Structured entries are also in C(details).
